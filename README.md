# BackendL5M2

This Repository contains a redone version of my Level 5 Mission Two's Backend.

My first attempt was a repository containing both Frontend and Backend, and it had a lot of superfluous folders and files.

<h4>GETTING STARTED:</h4>

1. Create Folder in VS Code (e.g. Backend)
2. Open Integrated Terminal from that folder
3. In terminal: git clone https://github.com/Jaxeus/BackendL5M2.git
4. In terminal: npm install (to install node_modules)
5. In terminal: npm run dev (to run the server with nodemon)
